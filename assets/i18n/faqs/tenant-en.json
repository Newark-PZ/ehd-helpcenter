The landlord must comply with such a request.  If the tenant causes damage to the apartment (beyond ordinary wear and tear), the landlord may require the tenant to pay for that damage if and when the landlord would otherwise have been entitled to recoup the cost from the security deposit.  The landlord may also require the tenant to post a new security deposit either six months after the end of the Public Health Emergency or when the lease is renewed.",

Any payments you miss now will become back-rent that you owe.One way or another, you will probably have to pay later whatever you cannot pay now, or you will ultimately face possible eviction.If you fall behind on your rent payments, you can try speaking with your landlord to work out a payment plan to avoid having an eviction action filed against you.

  "Question": "Do I still have to pay for utilities and water?",
  "Answer": "<b>Yes</b>. You still have to pay whatever electric, gas, or water bills you normally pay.If you cannot pay now, you will have to pay later.The utilities and water companies are not cancelling debts; they are just postponing shutoffs for the time being. DCA offers low-income tenants <a href='https://www.nj.gov/dca/divisions/dhcr/offices/hea.html'>assistance with some utility bills</a>.",
