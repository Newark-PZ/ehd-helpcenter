  "Answer": "<p><strong>No.</strong> On March 19, 2020, New Jersey Governor Philip Murphy issued <a href='https://nj.gov/infobank/eo/056murphy/pdf/EO-106.pdf'>Executive Order 106</a>, which immediately suspends evictions throughout the state. This is called an “eviction moratorium,” and it means that, except in rare circumstances, <strong>no tenant may be removed from his or her home as a result of an eviction proceeding</strong>. This state eviction moratorium does <strong>not</strong> affect court proceedings; instead, it prevents lockouts and removals. The New Jersey Supreme Court controls court proceedings related to eviction, which are suspended for now. More information is below.</p>",

  "Answer": "<p>The eviction moratorium began on March 19, 2020, and it will last until two months after Governor Murphy declares an end to the COVID-19 health crisis. The Governor has extended the official public health emergency several times, most recently through <a href='https://nj.gov/infobank/eo/056murphy/pdf/EO-162.pdf'>Executive Order 162</a>, which will expire on August 1. Unless the Governor extends the emergency again, or ends it early, the eviction moratorium will expire two months later, on October 1.</p><p>The moratorium applies to all pre-existing orders for removal.

  "Question": "What if I live in a hotel/motel? Can I be evicted while the Executive Order is in place?",
  "Answer": "<p><strong>Maybe.</strong> Governor Murphy’s <a href='https://nj.gov/infobank/eo/056murphy/pdf/EO-106.pdf'>Executive Order 106</a> <span>permits a hotel or motel to evict </span>a “transient guest or seasonal tenant.” Longtime hotel and motel residents, along with many others, are not considered “transient” or “seasonal,” however, and therefore remain protected from eviction under the Order. In general, residents cannot be evicted if they “have no permanent housing to which they may safely or lawfully return and live at a hotel or motel on a continual basis.” Under Administrative Orders <a href='https://d31hzlhk6di2h5.cloudfront.net/20200404/76/54/49/6d/782ba5a402ce762190ffdf92/AO_2020-8.pdf'>2020-08</a> and <a href='http://d31hzlhk6di2h5.cloudfront.net/20200424/b7/cb/1b/ce/b43a111240a42d0194ce7531/AO_2020-9.PDF'>2020-09</a> (issued by the State Director of Emergency Management on April 4 and April 24), the following hotel and motel residents are generally protected from eviction:</p><ul><li>those who are part of state initiatives aimed at getting people out of group shelters;</li><li>those supported by a governmental housing assistance program;</li><li>health-care workers who need a temporary place to stay;</li><li>homeless people;</li><li>individuals affected by domestic violence; and</li><li>those staying in hotels or motels in compliance with a court order.</li></ul><p>Others may be protected as well.

  "Question": "What if my landlord locks me out illegally?",
  "Answer": "<p>It is a crime for your landlord to lock you out. Under New Jersey law, only the courts can order evictions, and only government officials can remove you from your home. If your landlord locks you out, call the local police. They are required to help you get back into your home. If they tell you this is a “civil” matter that doesn’t involve them, ask them to look at this statute: N.J.S.A. 2C:33-11.1.</p>",

  "Answer": "<p><strong>Yes.</strong> On April 24, Governor Murphy issued <a href='https://nj.gov/infobank/eo/056murphy/pdf/EO-128.pdf'>Executive Order 128</a>, which allows tenants to request in writing (including by email or text) that their landlords apply their security deposits to the rent they owe during the Public Health Emergency and for up to 60 days afterwards. The landlord must comply with such a request. If the tenant causes damage to the apartment (beyond ordinary wear and tear), the landlord may require the tenant to pay for that damage if and when the landlord would otherwise have been entitled to recoup the cost from the security deposit. If the lease is renewed, the landlord may also require the tenant to post a new security deposit either six months after the end of the Public Health Emergency or when the lease is renewed, whichever is later.</p>",

  "Question": "Does federal law prevent my landlord from filing an eviction case against me?",
  "Answer": "<p><strong>Maybe.</strong> The federal <a href='https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/hr748/text'>CARES Act</a> prohibited covered landlords (see below) from filing an eviction complaint for nonpayment of rent between March 27 and July 25. If a landlord covered by the CARES Act filed such an eviction complaint during this period, the tenant can request that the case be dismissed. A dismissal will not stop the landlord from filing a new complaint, and the court may allow the landlord to certify compliance with the CARES Act to avoid dismissal of the complaint (see below).</p><p>Landlords covered by the CARES Act include:</p><ul><li>Those who hold a federally backed mortgage, such as a mortgage from Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or the Federal Housing Administration.</li><li>Those who rent to federally subsidized tenants, including tenants who:</li><li>live in public housing,</li><li>have a Section 8 Housing Choice voucher,</li><li>live in Section 8 project-based housing, or</li><li>live in other types of federally funded housing, including, among others, certain housing programs for seniors, people with disabilities, people with HIV/AIDS, and people at risk of homelessness.</li><li>The National Low-Income Housing Coalition has constructed a <a href='https://nlihc.org/federal-moratoriums'>searchable database</a> of many (but not all) of the properties covered by the CARES Act.</li></ul><p>After July 25, covered landlords who <span>want to evict a tenant for nonpayment of rent must first serve the tenant with a notice giving the tenant 30 days to vacate. The CARES Act states that a landlord</span> may not “require the tenant to vacate” the property until 30 days after giving the tenant a notice to vacate. In New Jersey, a landlord may not require a tenant to leave his or her home except through a court proceeding. Under the CARES Act, therefore, a covered landlord must give New Jersey tenants 30 days’ notice before such a court proceeding. In any case, a lockout cannot happen until the moratorium under <a href='https://nj.gov/infobank/eo/056murphy/pdf/EO-106.pdf'>Executive Order 106</a> is lifted.</p><p>As noted above, the CARES Act ban on eviction filings by covered landlords expired on July 25. Tenants should know, however, that the CARES Act also prohibited covered landlords from charging fees (such as late fees or attorney’s fees) related to nonpayment of rent between March 27 and July 25. Tenants in covered properties do not owe such fees.</p><p>The CARES Act gives tenants additional protection if they live in a building with five or more units and the owner got permission to delay payments on a federally backed mortgage loan. In that case, the owner may not file an eviction action for nonpayment of rent, or charge late fees related to nonpayment of rent, during the period when the owner is not making mortgage payments. When this period ends, the owner must give tenants 30 days’ notice before taking the tenant to court to get an order requiring the tenant to vacate the property (but the lockout cannot happen in any case until the moratorium under <a href='https://nj.gov/infobank/eo/056murphy/pdf/EO-106.pdf'>Executive Order 106</a> is lifted).</p><p>The New Jersey Supreme Court has required landlords to <a href='https://njcourts.gov/notices/2020/n200724a.pdf?c=DfF'>certify their compliance with the CARES Act</a>.</p>",

You can then withhold the money you spent on repairs from your rent (save all receipts for the repairs!).</p>",

  "Question": "Can my utilities be shut off during the COVID-19 crisis?",
  "Answer": "<p><strong>No.</strong> As of March 13, New Jersey’s electric and gas utilities <a href='https://www.bpu.state.nj.us/bpu/newsroom/2020/approved/20200313.html'>voluntarily suspended utility shut-offs</a>, and that suspension appears to be ongoing. Some of the utility companies are sending shut-off notices to residential tenants, but it seems they are not yet following through with actual shut-offs.</p>",

  "Question": "Do I still have to pay for utilities and water?",
  "Answer": "<p><strong>Yes.</strong> You still have to pay whatever electric, gas, or water bills you normally pay. If you cannot pay now, you will have to pay later. The utilities and water companies are not cancelling debts; they are just postponing shutoffs for the time being. DCA offers low-income tenants <a href='https://www.nj.gov/dca/divisions/dhcr/offices/hea.html'>assistance with some utility bills</a>, and you can call the customer service number on your utility bill to try to work out a payment plan.</p>",
