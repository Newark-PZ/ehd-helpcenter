  "Answer": "<p><strong>No.</strong> Lockouts of residential tenants (evictions) continue to be suspended in accordance with Executive Order 106.</p><p>On March 19, 2020, New Jersey Governor Philip Murphy issued <a href='https://nj.gov/infobank/eo/056murphy/pdf/EO-106.pdf'>Executive Order 106</a>, which immediately suspends evictions throughout the state. This is called an &ldquo;eviction moratorium,&rdquo; and it means that, except in rare circumstances, <strong>no tenant may be removed from his or her home as a result of an eviction proceeding</strong>. This state eviction moratorium does <strong>not</strong> affect court proceedings; instead, it prevents lockouts and removals. The New Jersey Supreme Court controls court proceedings related to eviction, which are suspended for now. More information is below.</p>",

  "Answer": "<p><strong>Yes.</strong> On April 24, Governor Murphy issued <a href='https://nj.gov/infobank/eo/056murphy/pdf/EO-128.pdf'>Executive Order 128</a>, which allows tenants to request in writing (including by email or text) that their landlords apply their security deposits to the rent they owe during the Public Health Emergency and for up to 60 days afterwards. The landlord must comply with such a request. If the tenant causes damage to the apartment (beyond ordinary wear and tear), the landlord may require the tenant to pay for that damage if and when the landlord would otherwise have been entitled to recoup the cost from the security deposit. If the lease is renewed, the landlord may also require the tenant to post a new security deposit either six months after the end of the Public Health Emergency or when the lease is renewed, whichever is later.&nbsp;</p><p>Tenants may report to State law enforcement any violations of any of the Governor's Executive Orders &ndash; including Executive Order 128 &ndash; by completing an <em>Executive Order Violation Reporting</em> form found at <a href='https://covid19.nj.gov/forms/violation'>https://covid19.nj.gov/forms/violation</a>.

  "Question": "Can my landlord increase my rent during the COVID crisis?",
  "Answer": "<p><strong>Maybe. </strong>So far, the state government has not banned rent increases during the crisis. In the absence of statewide protection, tenants retain whatever protections may already have applied, including lease provisions and rent control ordinances, which normally permit rent increases only once a year.</p><p>In addition, some tenants have special protections:</p><ul><li>On April 16, <a href='https://www.nj.gov/dca/hmfa/media/news/2020/approved/20200416.html'>Governor Murphy announced</a> that the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency (NJHMFA) had voted to prohibit rent increases for the duration of the Public Health Emergency in the 36,000 rental units the agency oversees. After the emergency ends, landlords in NJHMFA-regulated properties may raise rents up to 1.4% on 30 days&rsquo; notice to tenants.</li><li>On May 18, Newark&rsquo;s Mayor Baraka announced a <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oH4xOvsE53rc-GPau2CC65KrxWJiML7i/view'>temporary moratorium on all rent increases</a> for tenants living in properties covered by the <a href='https://www.newarknj.gov/departments/rentcontrol'>Newark Rent Control Ordinance</a>.

  "Question": "Does federal law prevent my landlord from filing an eviction case against me?",
  "Answer": "<p><strong>Maybe.</strong> Under the recently adopted federal <a href='https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/748/text'>CARES Act</a>, if the landlord has a federally backed mortgage, the landlord may not file an eviction action against you for nonpayment of rent, or charge you fees (such as late fees or attorney&rsquo;s fees) related to your nonpayment of rent, for 120 days from March 27, 2020 (or through July 25, 2020). After July 25, a landlord with a federally backed mortgage must give you 30 days&rsquo; notice before filing an eviction action.</p><p>As explained below under &ldquo;Subsidized Tenants,&rdquo; the 120-day federal eviction ban also extends to tenants living in public housing and participating in various other subsidized housing programs.</p><p>Additional protection may apply if the building where you live has five or more units and the owner got permission to delay payments on a federally backed mortgage loan. In that case, the owner may not file an eviction action against you for nonpayment of rent, or charge you fees related to nonpayment of rent, during the period when the owner is not making mortgage payments. When this period ends, the owner must give you 30 days&rsquo; notice before filing an eviction action against you.</p><p>The National Low-Income Housing Coalition has constructed a <a href='https://nlihc.org/federal-moratoriums'>searchable database</a> of many (but not all) of the properties covered by the federal law.</p><p><strong>You must still pay rent</strong>, and you will owe later what you don&rsquo;t pay now. Like the state orders, the federal law protects you from being removed from your home during the emergency, but you still owe the rent.</p>",

  "Answer": "<strong>Yes.</strong> You still have to pay whatever electric, gas, or water bills you normally pay. If you cannot pay now, you will have to pay later.
