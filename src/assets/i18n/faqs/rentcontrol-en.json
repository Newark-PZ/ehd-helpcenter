    "Question": "How much can a landlord increase rent every year?",
    "Answer": "<b>Landlords may increase rents once every twelve (12) months</b>. Rent increases are capped utilizing the Consumer Price Index-Urban percentage (CPI-U%) published every month. For example, if your current lease ends on April 31, 2017, then your landlord will have notified you 30 days in advance in writing (required by law) on April 1, 2017 indicating that you will receive an increase on May 1st using May 2017’s Percentage 2.6%. <b>For example, $1000 x 2.6% = $26.00. Then $1000 + $26 = New Rent = $1026.00</b>",
