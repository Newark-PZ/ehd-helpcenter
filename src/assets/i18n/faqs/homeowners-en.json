This is called an <i>eviction moratorium</i>, and it means that, except in rare circumstances, <strong>no homeowner may be removed from his or her home as a result of a foreclosure proceeding at this time</strong>. You cannot be removed even if a <a href='https://www.lsnjlaw.org/Housing/Home-Ownership/Foreclosure/Pages/Foreclosure-Process.aspx'>final judgment of foreclosure</a> has been entered and a <a href='https://www.lsnjlaw.org/Housing/Home-Ownership/Foreclosure/Pages/Foreclosure-Process.aspx'>sheriff's sale</a> of your property has taken place.

        "Answer": "<p><strong>Yes.</strong> You will have to make your mortgage payments sooner or later. If you need extra time, however, help is available.</p><p>If you have a federally backed mortgage, you have the right to ask your mortgage servicer for forbearance (a pause on payments) to relieve financial hardship arising from the pandemic. The recently adopted federal <a href='https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hr748/BILLS-116hr748eas.pdf'>CARES Act</a> requires servicers of federally backed mortgages to give struggling borrowers a 180-day grace period on payments. The borrower may request one extension of up to 180 days. During the grace period, the servicer cannot charge you fees, penalties, or interest other than what you would owe if you had paid on time.</p><p>In addition, Governor Murphy has announced some <a href='https://nj.gov/governor/news/news/562020/approved/20200328c.shtml'>important relief for homeowners with mortgages</a>, including those that are not backed by the federal government. If you contact your mortgage servicer, you may be eligible for: (1) a 90-day grace period for mortgage payments; (2) assurance that the servicer will not report late or missed payments during this period to credit agencies; (3) a 60-day moratorium on servicers' initiation of foreclosure sales or evictions; and (4) relief from certain fees and charges for at least 90 days.

        "Answer": "<strong>Yes, for some homeowners.</strong> On March 18, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced a <a href='https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/OCHCO/documents/20-04hsgml.pdf'>foreclosure and eviction moratorium</a> that applied to single-family homeowners with Federal Housing Authority (FHA)-insured mortgages for 60 days. <a href='https://www.fhfa.gov/Media/PublicAffairs/Pages/FHFA-Suspends-Foreclosures-and-Evictions-for-Enterprise-Backed-Mortgages.aspx'>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac</a> also suspended foreclosures and evictions for 60 days for homeowners behind on their mortgages.

        "Answer": "<b>That depends</b>. The Foreclosure Office administers parts of most foreclosure cases and manages most of the process when a foreclosure is uncontested, meaning that the homeowner did not file an answer to the complaint. Under an <a href='https://njcourts.gov/notices/2020/n200424a.pdf'>April 24 order</a> issued by the New Jersey Supreme Court, however, the Office of Foreclosure will not review or act on motions or judgments it received after March 1, 2020. Thus, if the lender asks the Foreclosure Office after March 1 to enter a final judgment against the homeowner or seeks other action to advance the foreclosure, the Office will hold those requests for now. The Supreme Courts order will remain in effect until the Court lifts it.
